# Application Protocol

Communication between client and server consists of both WebSocket messages and UDP packets. The client first establishes a WebSocket connection, which the server uses to send important but less frequent updates. The client and server then trade UDP packets with the frame-by-frame data to sync state.

I've decided to go with this for now because I like using UDP for the state updates, but I didn't want to write my own "connection based, in order, guaranteed delivery" protocol on top of UDP. I can get that from WebSockets relatively easily (from a dev perspective anyway).

# WebSocket Scheme

All messages are in JSON format, with a `type` field to indicate its purpose, as well as any other fields specific to that message type. For example, a `Connected` packet (described below) might look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "Connected",
  "id": 11,
  "players": [
    57,
    84,
    38
  ]
}
```

## Client to Server Messages

### `Connect`

The `Connect` message is sent after the WebSocket connection is established. This message has no additional fields, but may be updated in the future to validate the connection with a password or set a name for the player.

## Server to Client Messages

### `Connected`

The `Connected` message is sent in response to the `Connect` message to signal a successful connection.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | unsigned 8-bit integer | The id assigned to the player |
| `players` | array of unsigned 8-bit integers | The ids of all other currently connected players |

### `PlayerJoined`

The `PlayerJoined` message is sent when a new player connects to the server.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | unsigned 8-bit integer | The id of the player that just joined |

### `PlayerLeft`

The `PlayerLeft` message is sent when a connected player disconnects from the server.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | unsigned 8-bit integer | The id of the player that just left |

# UDP Scheme

## Client to Server Packets

After establishing a WebSocket connection and receiving a `Connected` packet, clients send a UDP packet every frame to inform the server of their current state. The update is 24 bytes long and has the following format:

* Player id (unsigned 8-bit integer, 1 bytes): the id of the player that was received in the `Connected` packet. The server rejects the packet if the id does not match a connected player.
* Update number (unsigned 32-bit integer, 4 bytes): this represents the number of milliseconds between when the client started sending updates to now. The server keeps the most recent N updates. (Currently, N = 20.)
* Zone (unsigned 32-bit integer, 4 bytes): a hash of the zone the player is in. The hash is calculated client-side and used by the client to determine whether another player is in the same zone.
* Transform (15 bytes):
  * Location: the location component of the player's transform, represented by three 32-bit floating point numbers (12 bytes).
  * Rotation: the rotation component of the player's transform, represented by three unsigned 8-bit integers (3 bytes).

Notes:

* Each number in the update is in big endian format.
* After player id and update number, the server doesn't do anything with the data except store it and pass it along to other players.
* Each value in the rotation component of the transform stays between -180.0 and 180.0. The update translates that to an unsigned 8-bit integer, so -180 would map to 0 and just under 180 would map to 255.
* I did a bit of testing and found that the scale component of the transform seems to always be (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), so it is not included in the update.

## Server to Client Packets

Once an update is accepted by the server, the server sends one or more UDP packets with the current state of other connected players in the same zone. An update is `24 * num_updates` bytes long. Each update is in the same format as a client to server packet, with at most one update per player per packet. When responding to a client packet, the server will send the most recent update it hasn't already tried to send for each other player.
Notes:

* `num_updates` will always be between 1 and 21, inclusive. So an update will have minimum length 24 and maximum length 504, and the length of an update mod 24 will always be 0.
* Currently the server caps the number of players at 22 so that all players will fit in a single update.
* This format sends unnecessary data, as it will still send the transform for a player in a different zone. This could be improved, but would require a more complicated message format. I'll come back to this later.

The client keeps track of the most recent N updates for each player (currently, N = 20). It calculates the average difference between its own update number and that of each other player to determine which update to play each frame.
