# Pseudoregalia Multiplayer

This is a mod for [Pseudoregalia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2365810/Pseudoregalia/) that enables online multiplayer play. Clients connect to a central server and state is shared between the clients.

Currently, all the mod does is sync player transforms (location/rotation), so you can see people moving around in real time. Other players show up as ghosts with the "spirit form" Sybil model, which is the one used on the title screen. Animations are NOT synced. Zone syncing works based on the name of the zone, so it already works with modded maps. More features coming soon..?

The mod uses UE4SS and was built to be compatible with [`pseudoregalia-archipelago`](https://github.com/qwint/pseudoregalia-archipelago). This mod is independent though; you don't need to use `pseudoregalia-archipelago` to use this mod.

Check out the [Releases](todo) page to download the mod and/or the server. Instructions for installing the mod can be found [here](./installing-the-mod.md). Instructions for running the server can be found [here](./running-the-server.md).
